# task 0 here üòÅ

In this and coming projects, I will be implementing from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, I will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to access it from here:
